#  Dependency Analyzer – Compiler Construction Project

This project is a **C file dependency analyzer** developed for a Compiler Construction course. It simulates the **front-end phases of a compiler** — Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, and Code Generation — by analyzing `#include` directives in C `.c` and `.h` source files.

It constructs a **directed graph** representing file include relationships and generates both `.dot` and `.png` files using Graphviz.

##  Compiler Phases Simulated

| Phase             | Module           | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Lexical Analysis | `lexer.py`       | Extracts `#include` directives using regex |
| Syntax Analysis  | `parser.py`      | Parses tokens into structured include lists |
| Semantic Analysis| `semantics.py`   | Resolves include file paths on disk |
| Code Generation  | `codegen.py`     | Generates `.dot` and `.png` from the graph |
| Integration      | `analyzer.py`    | Combines all phases to build the graph |

##  How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. Run analysis:

```bash
python run.py
```

### Output:

* `output1/`: Graph for `input/`
* `output2/`: Graph for `input2/`
